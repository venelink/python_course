       "  'Plot': 'Lasting just 61 seconds and consisting of two shots, the first shot is set in a wood during winter. The actor representing then vice-president Theodore Roosevelt enthusiastically hurries down a hillside towards a tree in the foreground. He falls once, but rights himself and cocks his rifle. Two other men, bearing signs reading \"His Photographer\" and \"His Press Agent\" respectively, follow him into the shot; the photographer sets up his camera. \"Teddy\" aims his rifle upward at the tree and fells what appears to be a common house cat, which he then proceeds to stab. \"Teddy\" holds his prize aloft, and the press agent takes notes. The second shot is taken in a slightly different part of the wood, on a path. \"Teddy\" rides the path on his horse towards the camera and out to the left of the shot, followed closely by the press agent and photographer, still dutifully holding their signs.'}]"
